# LCS Curses Viewer
 A tool to view/edit the cpc and cmv files from Liberal Crime Squad in a browser
# Todo:
 Currently, the tool can view the pictures of cpc and cmv files. Editing in cpc files is present but extremely limited.
 The plan is to add full editing functionality to cpc files. Then allow the edited files to be downloaded. After this,
 work can be done on editing cmv files. cmv files require more work as they have more header information. This is due 
 to the fact that each picture does not necessecarily correspond to a single frame - each frame can display multiple 
 pictures and each picture can appear in multiple frames. The documentation on this is not very clear, but frame details
 are found in the dummy variable.
